# covid19_word_embedding
Playing around with word vectors for SARS-CoV-2. Mucking around with the
[BioWordVec](https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioWordVec) prebuilt embeddings and
seeing what might be related to treatments for COVID-19.

I don't know a ton about Jupyter Notebooks, so no judging...


## Methods

### Getting potential drug/compound/target hits

I imagine most people who have knowledge of word embeddings are familiar with
the idea that there is semantic structure in the space, such that you can find
meaningful analogies.

The typical example of this is: *Man -> King* as *Woman -> ?* points one to
*Queen*. Effectively, the vector between Man and King represenst some kind of
"monarch/royalty" vector.

Here, I have just taken this same concept and tried to derive a "treats" vector.
At time of writing, I have only use metformin and diabetes as my seed analogy,
and I am using SARS and MERS as my endpoints. Thus, the analogies I am using to
get hits are: *Metformin -> Diabetes* as *? -> SARS* and *? -> MERS*.

I am then manually evaluating the top hits for each analogy. See my notes below.

### Direct drug repurposing

Given the urgency of the situation, drug repurposing is generally considered the
most valuable approach to finding treatments for COVID-19. Approved drugs can be
prescribed off label without the need for extensive clinical trials. That does
not preclude trials for efficacy, but we already know approved drugs have been
tested for safety.

Thus, there is an argument for filtering the potential drug/compound/target hits
to known FDA approved drugs. I downloaded the [FDA's approved drugs database](
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drugsfda-data-files) and
will be using this to filter hits from my previous step using two methods:
* Direct drug name string matching
* Multi-token vector similarity matching

## Results

You'll find notes on some of the most promising results below.

### Potential drug/compound/target hits

#### [SARS-3CLPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C30_Endopeptidase)
A family of enzymes found in coronaviruses. Cleave the coronavirus polyprotein
into multiple functional components for viral replication. Potential target for
inhibition.

"Molecular modeling suggests that available rhinovirus 3Cpro inhibitors may be
modified to make them useful for treating SARS"

#### [Cantharidin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantharidin)
A compound secreted by blister beetles. Causes severe chemical burns and
blistering when applied to the skin.

Absorbed by the lipid membranes of epidermal cells (I assume other cells too)
and causes the release of serine proteases, breaking down cell-to-cell
adhesion. Makes sense then that it causes blistering when applied to skin.

There is some evidence that Cantharidin can be used to inhibit Hepatitis B
production, but it's far too toxic to be ingested.

#### [Chelidonine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelidonine)
This is a tricky one. Chelidonine is an acetylcholinesterase and
butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor. Activity is generally associated with the
central nervous system.

One possible connection is that acetylcholinesterase degrades acetylcholine into
acetate and choline and, according to Wikipedia:
>The esteratic subsite, where acetylcholine is hydrolyzed to acetate and choline,
>contains the catalytic triad of three amino acids: serine 200, histidine 440 and
>glutamate 327. These three amino acids are similar to the triad in other serine
>proteases except that the glutamate is the third member rather than aspartate.

I'm outside my depth at this point, but serine protease TMPRSS2 is important for
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. It cuts open the spike protein of the virus. Tangential
relation to serine protease inhibition then? Importantly, there are several AChE
inhibitors that are safe and available.

Another possible connection is that chelidonine is the major alkaloid component
of Chelidonium majus which contains various isoquinoline alkaloids.
(Hydroxy)Chloroquine, which is currently being investigated for SARS-CoV-2
treatment, is a derivative of quinoline.

#### [SAR405](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sar405)
SAR405 is a selective Vps34 inhibitor. Vps34 phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol
to form phosphatidylinositol (3)-phosphate (PtdIns3P). PtdIns3P is a
phospholipid in cell membranes that recruits proteins to the membrane, many of
which are involved in protein trafficking.
