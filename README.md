# covid19_word_embedding
Playing around with word vectors for SARS-CoV-2.

Nothing to see here really. Just mucking around with the BioWordVec prebuilt
embeddings and seeing what might be related to treatments for COVID-19.

I don't know a ton about Jupyter Notebooks, so no judging...

### Summary of findings

Some notes on the hits that come up.

#### [Cantharidin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantharidin)
A compound secreted by blister beetles. Causes severe chemical burns and
blistering when applied to the skin.

Absorbed by the lipid membranes of epidermal cells (I assume other cells too)
and causes the release of serine proteases, breaking down cell-to-cell
adhesion. Makes sense then that it causes blistering when applied to skin.

There is some evidence that Cantharidin can be used to inhibit Hepatitis B
production, but it's far too toxic to be ingested.
